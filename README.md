# ProxyChunk

ProxyChunk is a web-based open proxy checker and aggregator app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Node >=v14.0
-   Yarn
-   PostgreSQL
-   Nginx

### Installation

1. Install [proxyshiva](https://github.com/octoman90/proxyshiva) and make sure it is in your [PATH](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>).
2. Create a user and a database in PostgreSQL for ProxyChunk to use.

4. Point Nginx to serve files from the `frontend/build` directory using this snippet:

```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name local;

	# Change this to where you have the frontend build directory
	root /path/to/where/you/have/ProxyChunk/frontend/build;

	location / {
		index index.html;
		try_files $uri /index.html;
	}
}
```

## Running

1. Run PostgreSQL and Nginx.
2. Run `yarn start` command.
